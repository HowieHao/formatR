Title: Format R Code Automatically
Version: 0.2-2
Date: 2011-04-08
Author: Yihui Xie
Maintainer: Yihui Xie <xie@yihui.name>
Description: This package provides a function tidy.source() and
	     optionally a GUI (by gWidgets and prefers gWidgetsRGtk2)
	     to format R source code.  Spaces and indent will be added
	     to the code automatically, and comments will be preserved
	     under certain conditions, so that R code will be more
	     human-readable and tidy.
